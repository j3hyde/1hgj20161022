This is a simple game -- wait, did I simple?  I meant _brain_dead_simple_ game of picking up limestone blocks to build a giant monolith to bring honour to your family name!  Really you just click around touching blocks.  There's no win/lose state or checking etc. etc.  Have fun?!

I should mention I didn't finish in the hour, but I got somewhere soon after - last modified 22:14 BST!
